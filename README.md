## Image search engine  
This project is a simple image search tool built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It uses the Unsplash API to fetch images based on what you search for. Just type a keyword into the search bar, and youâ€™ll get a set of relevant images displayed in a clean and easy-to-navigate layout.
